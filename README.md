 On the left panel, you’ll find options to select both categorical and numerical variables from the dataset. You can choose to filter the data based on specific factors, levels, or numeric ranges. Once you’ve narrowed down the data to your preferred subset, you can easily download it as a CSV file for further analysis.

In addition, the app provides opportunities to explore the data both visually and numerically. Simply toggle between the available categorical and numerical variables in the sidebar to adjust your analysis and gain insights from the data.
